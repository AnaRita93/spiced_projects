 WEEK 02: Classification Project with Titanic Data Set 

The Titanic passenger list can be used for an exercise classification task: Given the data of a new passenger, we want to predict whether they will survive the disaster.


During the week, work through the following steps:

- Explore the Titanic dataset

- Train a Logistic Regression classification model

- Create features using one-hot encoding

- Calculate the train and test accuracy

- Calculate a cross-validation score

- Train a Random Forest classification model

- Submit the predictions to Kaggle
